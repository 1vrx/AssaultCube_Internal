gng gng ts is a horrorCode™ classic... just sharing how i can create messy code and make absolute rubbish happen....
this was all done with no tutorials (other than aimbot math because my math wasnt working) but everything else was reversed myself and required no tutorials.


#AC internal

cli menu
- 
next project will use a simple imgui

mem writing and reading <templates and class ready to use>
-
can be used in any other internal program

-
simply loops through entities (will add to loop through amt of players) 

aimbot 
-
locks on to nearest enemy


legit a mess, but ive grasped the basics of an internal cheat.

I doubt any functioning human will gain any knowledge from reading this horrorCode™
